# [Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
The project is our take and learning by solvng problems from project Euler.
Each question will have it's own folder and then divided by language specific implementation.

Eg: 1 -> One<Optional name or handle>.java (for java implementation)
    1 -> One.py (for python)
